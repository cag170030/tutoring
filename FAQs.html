<p><b>Q</b>: Will there be SAT prep books & practice tests included? Is the camp only SAT tutoring or is there a separate session for the ACT?</p>

<p><b>A</b>: Upon successful completion of the camp, students will be awarded an SAT Practice Book with practice tests. The camp itself, though, is entirely self-contained and will assign homework and worksheets to students: no outside resources are needed.</p>

<p class="bottom-three">While we will be focusing on the SAT, most of our material will translate nicely to the ACT test. The main difference between the tests is in pacing. The ACT test also includes a science component. If you would like to take the ACT, you should work outside the camp to prepare for that component.</p> 





<p><b>Q</b>: What is the weekly schedule? What happens on Friday?</p>

<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>: The lecture is Monday-Thursday, 9am-11am central time. Friday is the instructors' office hours and is not mandatory, but we encourage students to do the homework in that time and treat it as a "study hall."  The homework is challenging; students can ask questions in that time. Students are also encouraged to attend their tutor's office hours.</p>



<p><b>Q</b>:Will the tutors be students volunteers or teachers and tutors?</p>

<p><b>A</b>:The tutors this summer are all high-achieving students at the University of Texas at Dallas. Many of them are National Merit Scholars and received near-perfect scores on the SAT. Several of them are McDermott Scholars, the university's highest scholastic honor. They are all experienced in teaching.</p>


<p class="bottom-three">In addition to daily lectures, you will have the chance to work one-on-one with these tutors throughout the week if you are seeking help on homework. I would go so far as to argue that the quality and accessibility of our instruction will be superior to that of private college prep academies.</p>


<p><b>Q</b>:What link do I need for me to be able to do the work?</p>

<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>:We have a course website where you will be able to download homework. Our online meetings will be held via Zoom.</p>


<p><b>Q</b>:Do I need to pay to use Zoom?</p>

<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>:No, you do not need to pay to join our Zoom classroom. There is no need for students to upgrade to Zoom Pro.</p>



<p><b>Q</b>:Where is the camp taking place?</p>

<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>:The SAT Camp this summer is virtual. It will take place on Zoom.</p>



<p><b>Q</b>:Do you supply books?</p>


<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>:Upon successful completion of the camp, students will be awarded an SAT Practice Book with practice tests. The camp itself, though, is entirely self-contained and will assign homework and worksheets to students: no outside resources are needed.</p>


<p><b>Q</b>:Will we be signing a virtual attendance sheet everyday?</p>


<p class="bottom-three"><b>A</b>:There will be random attendance checks throughout the camp. Moreover, the homework is challenging; it will be in your best interest to attend the lecture.</p>
